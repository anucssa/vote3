Vote3 Voting System - Audit Trail
=================================

A vote has been recorded in the Vote3 system.

The vote was recorded for election {{ vote.election.id }}: {{ vote.election.name }}.

{% if strict_secrecy %}
Because strict secrecy has been set, the vote code used has
deliberately not been recorded.
{% else %}
The vote code used was: {{ vote_code }}
{% endif %}

To aid verification that the vote recorded matches the voter's
intention, a list of POST variables submitted is recorded below:

{% for k, v in post.items %}{{ k }}: {{ v }}
{% endfor %}

Based on the submitted variables, the recorded vote was:
{% for p in vote.preference_set.all %}
{{ p.candidate.name }} ({{ p.candidate.id }}): {{ p.preference }}
{% endfor %}

If you are the voter and this does not match your intention, then
something is wrong. Please alert the returning officer.

integrity of the voting system may have been compromised.

Vote3 makes use of a hash chain to ensure the insertion, deletion or
modification of messages can be detected. 

The hash of the previous message is:
{{ hash }}

The next message in the audit trail must contain a SHA-384 hash of
this message (including the signature), encoded as UTF-8. If it does
not contain a hash, or the hash does not match the hash of this
