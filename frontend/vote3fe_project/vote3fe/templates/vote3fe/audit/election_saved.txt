This message should be GPG signed with the Vote3 voting system GPG
key. If it is not signed, or the signature does not verify, then the
integrity of the voting system may have been compromised.

Vote3 makes use of a hash chain to ensure the insertion, deletion or
modification of messages can be detected. 

The hash of the previous message is:
{{ hash }}

The next message in the audit trail must contain a SHA-384 hash of
this message (including the signature), encoded as UTF-8. If it does
not contain a hash, or the hash does not match the hash of this
message, then the integrity of the voting system may have been
compromised.
